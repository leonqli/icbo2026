<h1> ICBO 2025: 16th International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology <small>conference</small></h1>

## General Information 

The International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology (ICBO) is a premier annual conference series that brings together researchers, students and professionals involved in the development and application of ontologies in all areas of biology, medicine, diseases, human health, genome biology, environment, biomes, nutrition, food, plants, agriculture and others. Together, they address issues pertaining to coordinated development of ontological resources, data standards, as well as the optimal use of ontologies in applications.

As the biomedical sciences continue to generate and rely on complex, large-scale data, ontologies remain essential for enabling semantic clarity, data integration, and interoperability. In recent years, the growing role of AI and data-driven research has further increased the demand for robust, FAIR, and sustainable ontology infrastructures.

ICBO 2025 invites contributions that explore both foundational and applied aspects of biomedical ontologies, with a special focus on long-term sustainability, governance, tooling, and the evolving role of ontologies in AI-enabled biomedicine.

ICBO 2025 will be held online as a full virtual event. 


The focus of our 2025 conference is <b>Biological and Biomedical Ontologies in Action for Health, Science, and Sustainability</b>.
