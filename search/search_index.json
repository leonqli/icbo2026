Keynote Speakers \u00b6 Dr. Achille Zappa and Dr. Yukie Akune-Taylor Title: Glycoscience data and ontologies for understanding the expanded central dogma Bio: Dr. Achille Zappa and Dr. Yukie Akune-Taylor are conducting research at Glycan and Life Systems Integration Center (GaLSIC) at Soka University with Professor Kiyoko Aoki-Kinoshita. Their work focuses on exploring the complex functions of glycans using computational analysis and data mining techniques. This includes the development of glycan semantic knowledgebases, linked-data schemas and ontologies, as well as the analysis of glycan\u2013protein-lipid interactions. Abstract: Glycans play key roles for fundamental life-processes such as protein folding, cell\u2013cell communication, immune regulation, and development, yet their template-free biosynthesis and vast structural diversity make them challenging to study systematically. Our laboratory integrates glycoscience data with formal ontologies, semantic web technologies and linked-data principles to elucidate glycan-mediated regulatory mechanisms. We encode glycan structures, biosynthetic pathways, and functions in machine-readable scheme to enable interoperability with genomic, proteomic, and glycomic datasets. This semantic integration supports construction of system-level knowledge graph models that capture biochemical complexity and dynamic glycan modifications. By embedding glycans within functional networks, we extend the classical central dogma to represent multilayered regulation of gene expression and protein activity. The resulting knowledge framework accelerates hypothesis generation and data-driven knowledge discovery, elevating glycoscience within systems biology and advancing mechanistic understanding of molecular regulation in health and disease, and translational applications for diagnostics and therapeutics. Dr. Jian Du Title: Utilizing Large Language Models to Build Causal Diagrams for Observational Health Research Abstract: Determination of causality is a fundamental objective in observational health research. Causal diagrams, also known as causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), are increasingly utilized to depict assumed causal relations among exposures, outcomes, and secondary variables such as confounders, colliders, and mediators of the effects of interest. However, constructing DAGs typically relies on human-readable literature or significance tests for variable correlations, which is impractical with the growth of scientific literature and complexity of variable interactions. DAGs typically involve three fundamental types: common causes (confounders), common effects (colliders), and intermediates between the investigated exposure-outcome variables. Manually building such a graph with distinct structural information is time-consuming, error-prone, and unsystematic for health researchers. This lecture introduces a knowledge-driven approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge graph to automate the construction of DAGs. It is expected to reduce information burden for health researchers in variables selection during causal modeling using observational health data. Bio: Jian Du obtained his PhD degree from School of Information Management, Nanjing University. He is am now an assistant professor at the National Institute of Health Data Science, Peking University. He has a mixed background of Biomedical Informatics and Library & Information Science. Before joining Peking University, he served as a research scientist at Institute of Medical Information, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Since 2020, he has led the Computable Biomedical Knowledge Group (cbk.bjmu.edu.cn), which focuses on natural language processing, literature mining and knowledge graph construction, and their applications in clinical epidemiology for major chronic diseases. His group is currently funded by the National Key R&D Program for Young Scientists and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Dr. Du also contributes to the academic community as an editorial board member for Scientific Data, Health Data Science and BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making. Dr. Junguk Hur Title: Unlocking Biomedical Knowledge with LLMs: Literature Mining for Protein Interactions and Vaccine Adjuvant Research Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Llama, and Gemma are transforming biomedical text mining by enabling contextual understanding beyond traditional rule-based systems like SciMiner. This keynote introduces applications of LLMs for extracting protein\u2013protein interactions and vaccine adjuvant information from the scientific literature. GPT-based models achieved performance comparable to BioBERT in identifying PPIs, while LLMs effectively recognized adjuvant names and immune response mechanisms, contributing to knowledge integration within VIOLIN and Vaxjo. Together, these studies demonstrate how LLMs can convert unstructured biomedical literature into structured, actionable knowledge to accelerate discoveries across molecular and vaccine research. Bio: Junguk Hur, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Director of the Computational Data Analysis Core at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences. His research integrates bioinformatics, systems biology, and literature mining to analyze and interpret multi-omics and biomedical big data, with applications in metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration, and host-pathogen interactions. Dr. Hur also leads ontology-driven research to improve data integration and knowledge discovery across diverse biomedical domains. Invited Speakers \u00b6 Dr. Bairong Shen Title: Disease-Specific Ontology-Driven Intelligent Medicine Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) lack clinical domain expertise, limiting their medical use\u2014underscoring the need for disease-specific ontologies (DSOs) to advance precision and intelligent medicine. Unlike broad ontologies (e.g., ICD-11, SNOMED CT), DSOs deliver in-depth, standardized disease representations, fulfilling demands for detailed, condition-specific data. Over the past decade, we developed MIO, EXMO, PCLiON, and PCAO2, which enable deep data sharing in precision care. Their iterative evolution supports granular data collection, foundational for patient digital twins and personalized profiles. Integrated with knowledge graphs (KGs), DSOs enhance intelligent medicine: aiding sepsis care via LLM-driven KGs and RAG platforms (e.g., MetaSepsisKnowHub); enabling prostate cancer tools like RARPKB and ontology-based chatbots; strengthening rare disease research through graph-augmented LLMs; and supporting lung cancer analysis via UMLS-powered patient graphs. DSOs\u2019 potential lies in expanding precision KGs horizontally, offering an alternative to vertical LLM applications and boosting collaborative, personalized care. Bio: Dr. Bairong Shen is the Director and Professor of the Institute of System Genetics at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Currently, he also serves as a visiting professor at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle and the University of the Basque Country in Spain. He is the head of the virtual teaching and research laboratory for the \"Medical Data Collection and Analysis based on Science, Technology, and Information\" course under the \"101 Plan\" of the Ministry of Education. Since returning to China in 2008, he has led more than 10 national projects and supervised over 100 graduate students. He has published over 300 papers in international interdisciplinary journals and edited more than 10 English and Chinese books in the field of translational informatics. His research interests include the theory of biomarker discovery, biomedical data sharing and security, and intelligent chronic disease management.

It's built on the Bootstrap 3 framework and includes pre-packaged: highlight.js v9.18.0 syntax highlighting with support for 185 languages (over 30 by default) and over 90 styles FontAwesome v5.12.0 icon support smashingly legible type scheme to get your message out to your users You are viewing the theme in action and can see a selection of the theme elements on the Specimen page . Install \u00b6 Required : Python 3.4+ Install MkDocs & Create a New Project \u00b6 If you haven't installed MkDocs yet, use the following command to install it: $ pip install mkdocs Next, navigate to a clean directory and create a new MkDocs project with the following command: $ mkdocs new [projectname] Replace [projectname] with the name of your project (without the brackets). Then navigate to the root of your project directory: $ cd [projectname] Install the Cinder Theme \u00b6 Download the Cinder theme archive by clicking the button below. Download Cinder Unpack the contents of the archive into a directory named cinder at the top level of your MkDocs project directory. Your project directory should now look like this: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 cinder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 js \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 content.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 404.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav-sub.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav.html \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 toc.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 docs \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md MkDocs projects use a YAML settings file called mkdocs.yml . This is located in the root of your project directory after you use the mkdocs new command. Open the file in a text editor and modify it to include the theme settings as follows: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: name: null custom_dir: 'cinder' nav: - Home: index.md See the MkDocs documentation for additional details. Updates, the Manual Approach If you choose the manual install approach, you can update your Cinder theme by downloading the new cinder.zip release archive and including it in your project. Then re-build your static site files (see instructions below). Test with a Local Site Server \u00b6 Use the following command to establish a local server for your site: $ mkdocs serve Then open your site in any browser at the URL http://localhost:8000 . Create Your Site \u00b6 Add Content with Markdown Syntax \u00b6 Get to work on your site home page by opening the docs/index.md file and editing it in Markdown syntax. The HTML automatically updates in the browser when you save the Markdown file if you use the MkDocs server (see command above). Add New Pages \u00b6 Add new pages to your site by creating a new Markdown file in your docs directory, then linking to the new page in the mkdocs.yml file. This uses a Page Name : Markdown file syntax. For example, to add an About page using a Markdown file that is located on the path docs/about.md , you would format the mkdocs.yml file as follows: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: name: null custom_dir: 'cinder' nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Add additional pages to your site by repeating the above series of steps. Build Your Site \u00b6 Build your site files with the command: $ mkdocs build Your site files are built in the site directory and are ready to use. Deploy the contents of the site directory to your web server. Important Configuration Issues \u00b6 Please review these issues before you push your site into a production setting! 1. Set the site_url configuration field \u00b6 You must set the site_url field in your mkdocs.yml file to the appropriate production URL in order to generate a valid sitemap.xml file ( issue #80 ). Here is an example from the Cinder project mkdocs.yml file : site_name: Cinder site_url: https://sourcefoundry.org/cinder/ site_author: Christopher Simpkins site_description: \"A clean, responsive theme for static documentation websites that are generated with MkDocs\" repo_url: \"https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder\" copyright: \"Cinder is licensed under the <a href='https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder/blob/master/LICENSE.md'>MIT license</a>\" theme: name: null custom_dir: cinder colorscheme: github highlightjs: true hljs_languages: - yaml nav: - Home: index.md - Specimen: specimen.md markdown_extensions: - admonition The sitemap.xml file will be located at [SITE_URL]/sitemap.xml when you push your site into the production environment. During development the sitemap.xml file can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8000/sitemap.xml . Site Customization \u00b6 The following are a few common customizations that you might be interested in. For much more detail about the configuration of your site, check out the MkDocs Configuration documentation . Syntax Highlighting Color Scheme \u00b6 Cinder supports the 90+ highlightjs color schemes . The github color scheme that you see on this page is the default and will be used if you do not specify otherwise. To change to a different scheme, include the colorscheme field under the theme field in your mkdocs.yml file and enter the color scheme name. For example, to switch to the Dracula theme , enter the following: theme: name: null custom_dir: cinder colorscheme: dracula and then rebuild your site. The color scheme name should match the base name of the highlightjs CSS file. See the src/styles directory of the highlightjs repository for a complete list of these CSS paths. Syntax Highlighting Language Support \u00b6 By default, Cinder supports the ~30 syntaxes listed under common in the documentation . You can broaden support to any of the over 130 highlightjs languages using definitions in your mkdocs.yml file. To add a new language, create a list of additional languages as a hljs_languages sub-field under the theme field in the mkdocs.yml file. The definitions are formatted as a newline-delimited list with - characters. For example, to add support for the Julia and Perl languages, format your configuration file like this: theme: name: null custom_dir: cinder hljs_languages: - julia - perl Use the base file name of the JavaScript files located in the CDN for your syntax definitions. Site Favicon \u00b6 Create an img subdirectory in your docs directory and add a custom favicon.ico file. See the MkDocs documentation for additional details. Add Your Own CSS Stylesheets \u00b6 Create a css directory inside your docs directory and add your CSS files. You can overwrite any of the Cinder styles in your CSS files. Then include your CSS files in the mkdocs.yml file with the extra_css field: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder extra_css: - \"css/mystyle.css\" - \"css/myotherstyle.css\" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Your CSS styles fall at the end of the cascade and will override all styles included in the theme (including Bootstrap and default Cinder styles). You can find the Cinder and Bootstrap CSS files on the paths cinder/css/cinder.css and cinder/css/bootstrap.min.css , respectively. Add Your Own JavaScript \u00b6 Create a js directory inside your docs directory and add your JS files. Then include your JS files in the mkdocs.yml file with the extra_js field: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder extra_js: - \"js/myscript.js\" - \"js/myotherscript.js\" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Keyboard shortcuts \u00b6 Place the following in your mkdocs.yml file to enable keyboard shortcuts: shortcuts: help: 191 # ? next: 39 # right arrow previous: 37 # left arrow search: 83 # s The numbers correspond to the key that you would like to use for that shortcut. You can use https://keycode.info/ to find the keycode you want. Extending Cinder \u00b6 Create a new directory within your project (e.g., cinder-theme-ext/ ) and create main.html . Add the following line at the top of the HTML file. {% extends \"base.html\" %} Instead of using theme_dir: cinder in mkdocs.yml , use: theme: name: cinder custom_dir: [custom dir] Refer to MkDocs Documentation - Using the theme custom_dir for more information. Use the following examples as reference. You can put your own Jinja2 within the blocks. More information can be found in MkDocs Documentation - Overriding Template Blocks . Adding extra HTML to the head tag \u00b6 Append to main.html : {% block extrahead %} <meta name=\"author\" content=\"{{ page.meta.author }}\"> {% endblock %} Replacing footer \u00b6 Append to main.html : {% block footer %} <hr> <p>{% if config.copyright %} <small>{{ config.copyright }}<br></small> {% endif %} <small>Documentation built with <a href=\"http://www.mkdocs.org/\">MkDocs</a>.</small> {% if page.meta.revision_date %} <small><br><i>Updated {{ page.meta.revision_date }}</i></small> {% endif %} </p> {% endblock %} page.meta.revision_date can be set by using meta-data (front-matter) at the beginning of your Markdown document or using mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin . Github or Bitbucket Repository Link \u00b6 Include the repo_url field and define it with your repository URL: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder repo_url: \"https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder\" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md The link appears at the upper right hand corner of your site. License Declaration and Link \u00b6 The Cinder theme displays your license declaration in the footer if you include a copyright field and define it with the text (and optionally the HTML link) that you would like to display: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder copyright: \"Cinder is licensed under the <a href='https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder/blob/master/LICENSE.md'>MIT license \" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Disabling Theme Features \u00b6 The Cinder theme can turn off some theme features entirely in mkdocs.yml , for situations where you don't need these features. If this is all the customization required, it saves overriding theme files. For example: theme: name: cinder # Turn off Previous/Next navigation links in the navbar disable_nav_previous_next: true # Turn off Search in the navbar disable_nav_search: true # Turn off the site_name link in the navbar disable_nav_site_name: true # Turn off the footer entirely disable_footer: true # Turn off the default footer message, but display the page revision date if it's available disable_footer_except_revision: true Issues \u00b6 If you have any issues with the theme, please report them on the Cinder repository: Report Issue Active Issues License \u00b6 Cinder is licensed under the MIT license .","title":"Example1"},{"location":"example1/#about","text":"Cinder is a clean, responsive theme for static documentation sites that are generated with MkDocs .

This can be readily observed in fields such as software engineering, where developers are increasingly using AI tools and even \u2018vibe coding\u2019 entire projects. However, much of this impact has yet to filter down to curation and ontology development. Many ontology developers report that they are either distrustful of AI, or they don\u2019t know where to start. Additionally, ontology developers may think that parts of their workflow are too complex to use in AI. In fact, AI is particularly well suited to many complex aspects of ontology development, and if used correctly, can be deployed with high reliability, while giving the human experts full control over tasks. Some ontologies, such as Mondo, Uberon, and the GO, have already successfully incorporated ontology agents into their GitHub-based workflows. In this tutorial, we will give a practical hands-on guide to ontology developers, showing how to use the latest powerful agent-based AI to support and accelerate their work. At the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to use an AI coding agent as a part of their day-to-day workflow. Annotating Data with Ontologies: LinkML Can Help Organizers Sierra Moxon (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) Kevin Schaper (Translational and Integrative Sciences Lab, University of North Carolina) Matt Brush (Translational and Integrative Sciences Lab, University of North Carolina) Chris Mungall (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) Melissa Haendel (Translational and Integrative Sciences Lab, University of North Carolina Date of Workshop November 5 Time and Timezone of Workshop 8am PT Abstract This tutorial introduces LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language), an open framework that simplifies the process of authoring, validating, and sharing data. LinkML offers an approachable syntax that is not tied to any one technical architecture, and can be integrated seamlessly with many existing frameworks. A low barrier to entry enables people from different backgrounds and varying levels of technical expertise to collaborate, forming a shared understanding of the underlying data semantics and contributing to data annotation and ontology integration. Workshop on the Core Ontology for Biology and Biomedicine Organizers Sebastian Duesing (La Jolla Institute for Immunology) Bjoern Peters (La Jolla Institute for Immunology) James Overton (Knocean, Inc.) Randi Vita (La Jolla Institute for Immunology) Chris Mungall (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) Abstract The Core Ontology for Biology and Biomedicine (COB) is a BFO-compatible upper-level ontology used by the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry. COB provides a direct parent for the top-level classes in every OBO ontology, and so OBO ontologies that use COB are interoperable. Therefore, COB adoption makes interoperability measurable within the OBO Foundry, a critical step towards the Foundry's goal of ensuring the testability of all its principles. After a robust development push following the 2024 COB Workshop at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, the COB development team is focused on making COB adoption faster, easier, and more rewarding. The purpose of this workshop is to engage and train others to adopt COB in their own ontologies and participate in future COB development. AI, Ontologies, and the Next Generation of Researchers (Workshop for PhD Students & Early Career Researchers) Organizers Olga Mashkova (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) Anthony Huffman (University of Michigan) Date of Workshop November 10 Time and Timezone of Workshop 9am-11am ET Abstract This interactive panel discussion brings together senior researchers to share insights and advice with early-career colleagues working in biomedical ontologies and knowledge representation. Panelists will reflect on key career decisions, essential skills beyond technical expertise, and strategies for resilience in research. The discussion will explore the evolving role of artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) in ontology development, addressing how these technologies can drive real-world impact, support industry, and tackle global challenges such as public health and climate change. The panel will also consider how to foster community governance, and uphold ethical responsibility in ontology-driven applications. The session aims to inspire the next generation of researchers while promoting dialogue on the future of ontologies for health, science, and sustainability. Food, Waste, and Sustainability: Synergizing Ontology Efforts Organizers Giorgio Ubbiali (OTH Brixen College) Ludger Jansen (PTH Brixen College) Date of Workshop November 14 Time and Timezone of Workshop 4pm-7pm CET Abstract To date, food and plastic waste deriving from human consumption and other supply chain activities pose serious challenges to human health and the resilience and sustainability of food systems. Ontologies play an essential role in enhancing interconnections among datasets, data sources, and people, proving to be critical means to deal with complex health and sustainability issues, such as food and plastic waste. If originally, ontology efforts mainly centered on developing resources addressing health and related features, recently, attention has also been dedicated to sustainability issues. It is imperative to enhance interconnectedness among these ontologies and related applications. In particular, it will be important to communicate across different ontology communities to adequately capture the intrinsic connections between health and sustainability. This workshop aims to promote discussions in this direction, focusing on waste as a starting use case. First, we will explore the current conceptualization of waste, especially food and plastic waste in food systems. Then, we will move to discuss the corresponding existing ontologies and models. Finally, we will engage with subject matter experts, conversating on how to synergize sustainability and health ontologies across ontology communities for food systems waste. 14th Vaccine and Drug Ontology Studies (VDOS) 2025 Workshop Organizers Junguk Hur (University of North Dakota) Yongqun He (University of Michigan) Cui Tao (Mayo Clinic) Date of Workshop November 7 Time and Timezone of Workshop tbd Abstract We propose the 14th Vaccine and Drug Ontology Studies (VDOS) workshop at the 16th International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2025). This year, we extend our focus to encompass artificial intelligence's transformative role in drug and vaccine ontology research. The workshop aims to explore innovative solutions and challenges in representing and analyzing drugs and vaccines, covering administration, immune responses, adverse events, and more. Key topics include the ontological representation of drugs and vaccines, real-world application challenges, drug components, administration, immune responses, drug interactions, and adverse events in clinical and research settings. A special emphasis will be placed on how AI can revolutionize ontology studies, enhancing literature mining, meta-analysis, and complex data interpretation. Despite progress, challenges remain in fully representing and utilizing ontologies for research and clinical issues, such as detailed representation of administration and adverse events, drug interactions, and analysis of immune responses. The workshop will bring together experts from clinical, research, and pharma-biotech sectors to discuss solutions to these challenges, aiming to foster advancements in drug development, administration, and the integration of AI in ontological research. Our goal is to contribute to public health improvement by enhancing the understanding and application of drug and vaccine ontologies.

Despite progress, challenges remain in fully representing and utilizing ontologies for research and clinical issues, such as detailed representation of administration and adverse events, drug interactions, and analysis of immune responses. The workshop will bring together experts from clinical, research, and pharma-biotech sectors to discuss solutions to these challenges, aiming to foster advancements in drug development, administration, and the integration of AI in ontological research. Our goal is to contribute to public health improvement by enhancing the understanding and application of drug and vaccine ontologies.","title":"Workshops Details"},{"location":"program/#contact-information","text":"Please direct all further questions to Asiya Yu Lin (ontology.world@gmail.com)","title":"Contact Information"},{"location":"registration/","text":"ICBO 2025 conference Conference 2025 Registration \u00b6 Registration for ICBO main conference, workshops, and ICBO EAST 2025 \u00b6 Registration is closed.
